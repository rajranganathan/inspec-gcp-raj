title: About the google_compute_backend_bucket resource
platform: gcp
---

## Syntax
A `google_compute_backend_bucket` is used to test a Google BackendBucket resource


## Beta Resource
This resource has beta fields available. To retrieve these fields, include `beta: true` in the constructor for the resource

## Examples
```
describe google_compute_backend_bucket(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', name: 'inspec-gcp-backend-bucket') do
  it { should exist }
  its('description') { should eq 'Backend bucket example' }
  its('enable_cdn') { should be 'true' }
  its('bucket_name') { should eq 'gcp-inspec-storage-bucket' }
end

describe google_compute_backend_bucket(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', name: 'nonexistent') do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

## Properties
Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_backend_bucket` resource:


  * `bucket_name`: Cloud Storage bucket name.

  * `cdn_policy`: Cloud CDN configuration for this Backend Bucket.

    * `signed_url_cache_max_age_sec`: Maximum number of seconds the response to a signed URL request will be considered fresh. After this time period, the response will be revalidated before being served. When serving responses to signed URL requests, Cloud CDN will internally behave as though all responses from this backend had a "Cache-Control: public, max-age=[TTL]" header, regardless of any existing Cache-Control header. The actual headers served in responses will not be altered.

    * `default_ttl`: (Beta only) Specifies the default TTL for cached content served by this origin for responses  that do not have an existing valid TTL (max-age or s-max-age).

    * `max_ttl`: (Beta only) Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin.

    * `client_ttl`: (Beta only) Specifies the maximum allowed TTL for cached content served by this origin.

    * `negative_caching`: (Beta only) Negative caching allows per-status code TTLs to be set, in order to apply fine-grained caching for common errors or redirects.

    * `negative_caching_policy`: (Beta only) Sets a cache TTL for the specified HTTP status code. negativeCaching must be enabled to configure negativeCachingPolicy. Omitting the policy and leaving negativeCaching enabled will use Cloud CDN's default cache TTLs.

      * `code`: (Beta only) The HTTP status code to define a TTL against. Only HTTP status codes 300, 301, 308, 404, 405, 410, 421, 451 and 501 can be specified as values, and you cannot specify a status code more than once.

      * `ttl`: (Beta only) The TTL (in seconds) for which to cache responses with the corresponding status code. The maximum allowed value is 1800s (30 minutes), noting that infrequently accessed objects may be evicted from the cache before the defined TTL.

    * `cache_mode`: (Beta only) Specifies the cache setting for all responses from this backend. The possible values are: USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS, FORCE_CACHE_ALL and CACHE_ALL_STATIC
    Possible values:
      * USE_ORIGIN_HEADERS
      * FORCE_CACHE_ALL
      * CACHE_ALL_STATIC

    * `serve_while_stale`: (Beta only) Serve existing content from the cache (if available) when revalidating content with the origin, or when an error is encountered when refreshing the cache. 

  * `custom_response_headers`: (Beta only) Headers that the HTTP/S load balancer should add to proxied responses.

  * `creation_timestamp`: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

  * `description`: An optional textual description of the resource; provided by the client when the resource is created.

  * `enable_cdn`: If true, enable Cloud CDN for this BackendBucket.

  * `id`: Unique identifier for the resource.

  * `name`: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035.  Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?` which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash.

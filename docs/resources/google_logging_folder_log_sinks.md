title: About the google_logging_folder_log_sinks resource
platform: gcp
---

## Syntax
A `google_logging_folder_log_sinks` is used to test a Google FolderLogSink resource

## Examples
```
# Getting folder sinks is complicated due to the name being generated by the server.
# This can be drastically simplified if you have the folder name when writing the test
describe.one do
  google_resourcemanager_folders(parent: 'organizations/12345').names.each do |folder_name|
    # name on a folder is in the form `folders/12345`
    describe google_logging_folder_log_sinks(folder: folder_name.split('/')[1]) do
      its('names') { should include 'inspec-gcp-folder-sink' }
      its('filters') { should include 'resource.type = gce_instance AND severity >= ERROR' }
    end
  end
end
```

## Syntax
A `google_compute_url_map` is used to test a Google UrlMap resource


## Beta Resource
This resource has beta fields available. To retrieve these fields, include `beta: true` in the constructor for the resource

## Properties
Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_url_map` resource:


  * `creation_timestamp`: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format.

  * `default_service`: The full or partial URL of the defaultService resource to which traffic is directed if none of the hostRules match. If defaultRouteAction is additionally specified, advanced routing actions like URL Rewrites, etc. take effect prior to sending the request to the backend. However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if routeAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, service must not be specified. Only one of defaultService, defaultUrlRedirect or defaultRouteAction.weightedBackendService must be set.

  * `description`: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource.

  * `id`: The unique identifier for the resource.

  * `fingerprint`: Fingerprint of this resource. A hash of the contents stored in this object. This field is used in optimistic locking.

  * `header_action`: Specifies changes to request and response headers that need to take effect for the selected backendService. The headerAction specified here take effect after headerAction specified under pathMatcher.

However, if defaultService is specified, defaultRouteAction cannot contain any weightedBackendServices. Conversely, if defaultRouteAction specifies any weightedBackendServices, defaultService must not be specified.
